      ACT I
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>A small room on the first floor, awkwardly overcrowded with the entire
      furniture of a cottage, a pile of which is stacked in the left corner and
      covered with a sheet; the plain iron bed is right, the window coming
      between its foot and the pile of furniture; table centre; three plain
      upright chairs and one wicker armchair before the fire; fireplace left;
      opposite it right a kitchen dresser well stocked with crockery; pans and
      kettle about the fireplace. For all the uncomfortable crowding the room is
      bright and well kept. Door right. It is 7 p.m. on a September evening, and
      the approach of dusk is noticed gradually.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jim Pilling, a gardener, has finished tea and sits in his shirt-sleeves
      before the d√©bris of the meal facing spectator lighting a briar pipe. Jim
      is thirty, clean looking, dressed in his rough working clothes without
      coat or his combined collar and "dicky" and red tie, which hangs with the
      coat behind the door. Sally Pilling is transferring the last of the table
      utensils to a tray which she puts on the bed; then removing the white
      cloth and shaking crumbs into the fire; a red cloth is underneath. Sally
      is of the pale complexion usual to a country girl living in a town; she
      dresses neatly and has an apron on; Dick, a thin boy of eight, in a blue
      sailor suit, gets off his chair at the table.</i>

    <p>
      <b>Dick</b>. Can I go out and play now, mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Jim rises and crosses l. with chair.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. Yes. (<i>She crosses to door and takes down from a hook his sailor
      hat.</i>) Here's your hat. (<i>Dick comes to her; she secures it on his
      head with an elastic band.</i>) Don't go far from the door, Dick. I'll
      shout you when it's bedtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. And don't get playing in the road&mdash;keep on the footpath.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dick</b>. Yes, dad. (<i>He runs out as Sally opens: the door.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. Don't get run over now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. The young <i>'</i>un misses the country. (<i>Sits in armchair above
      fire.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b> (<i>closing door</i>). We all do that, Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Aye. Streets are no sort of playground for a growing child. Did you
      get out while he was at school this afternoon?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b> (<i>gathering up tea-things</i>). Oh, yes. There's not the cleaning
      to do in a single room to keep me in it all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. No; better for you to get out a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b> (<i>dully</i>). It's no pleasure walking in the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Not when there's shops to look at?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. You can get tired of shops. (<i>Tea-things on tray.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. You're no true woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. I'm no town's woman. (<i>Crosses to Jim.</i>) I miss the flowers
      and the green. I'm pining for the country, Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. And I'm same way, only I do get the smell of the earth in Mr.
      Vining's garden and it's not so bad for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b> (<i>wistfully standing above his chair</i>). I'd dearly love to see
      that garden, Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. I know you would; but they're that strict about the Polygon. No
      getting in unless you've business.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. It does seem hard when there's not a park nor so much as a blade of
      grass in the whole blessed town except the Polygon. (<i>Puts tray on bed.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. The old days were the best, Sally, on the estate where we were born.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. We didn't know it, either, till Sir Charles began to sack his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. No; many a time I've grumbled at the work there and the pay. It's a
      judgment on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. You weren't sacked for grumbling. (<i>Shaking cloth in fire.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>bitterly</i>). No. I was sacked because Sir Charles lost so much
      money on the turf he couldn't keep six gardeners any longer&mdash;and me
      the one to go because we'd only our Dick and t'others had more childer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b> (<i>mildly surprised at his tone</i>). Gentlemen will have their
      sport, Jim. It might be worse. You dropped lucky into a job. (<i>Folds
      cloth and puts in dresser drawer.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Aye, the job's all right, and Mr. Vining's a good gentleman to work
      for&mdash;pay's better than the country an' all, though I can't get stuff
      to thrive in Mr. Vining's garden as I'd wish. (<i>Rises.</i>) Town air
      kills 'em. Yes, we'd do all right, Sally, if (<i>looking round as if caged</i>)&mdash;if
      there was room to live. That's what we want&mdash;room to live. We've our
      sticks for a proper house eating their heads off in yon corner (<i>indicating
      the pile</i>), and I've wages enough to pay rent for a house and no one
      'ull take it from me. There's not a house to let in all Carrington, nor
      like to be but what there's plenty waiting for it before our turn come,
      and we've waited three years now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b> (<i>consoling him</i>). Never mind, Jim. We've got our privacy.
      We've a room to ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>She crosses to cupboard, gets work out and puts on table.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>hotly</i>). A room! One room! (<i>Cooling.</i>) Aye, but you're
      right. Let's be thankful for small mercies. (<i>Sits.</i>) I mind it
      looked like we shouldn't even find a room when we came seeking. But it's
      hard to live decent in here, and it's harder on Dick than us. Eat and
      sleep an all in one room's not a Christian way of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>A knock at the door. Sally opens it. Walter Montgomery stands without.
      He is a curate, twenty-eight years old, athletic in build, clean-shaven,
      with a bright manner and a strong jaw.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. May I come in? Good evening, Mrs. Pilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. Surely, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter Walter. Sally closes the door, adroitly taking her apron off as
      she does so and hanging it up. Jim makes for his coat.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Good evening, Mr. Pilling. (<i>Seeing his objective.</i>) You're
      all right as you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Shirt-sleeves don't seem respectful, sir. Walter (<i>genially</i>)..
      Rubbish. It's a pity if you can't be cool in your own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>apologetically</i>). The fire does make it hot in here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. And we must have a fire to boil the kettle, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Walter looks at the closed window, but, having experience, makes no
      suggestion. Jim knocks his pipe out on the fire-bar.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>seeing him, but too late to stop him</i>). Oh, don't do that&mdash;here,
      try a pipe of mine. (<i>Delving in his coat tails for pouch and offering
      it.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>shyly</i>). Well, sir&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Go on, man. (<i>Jim accepts and fills his pouch; Sally dusts a
      chair with the corner of the table cloth.</i>) Now you know that chair
      didn't need dusting, Mrs. Pilling. (<i>He sits.</i>) Well, how's the
      garden, Mr. Pilling?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Oh, nicely, sir, nicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Yes. So I thought when I had a look at it over the hedge. (<i>Turning
      to Sally.</i>) I live next door to Mr. Vining, you know, Mrs. Pilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. Oh, but he can't get the garden to suit him, sir. (<i>Sits R. of
      table.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Oh! How's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Thanks. (<i>Returning pouch. Walter fills a pipe and lights up.</i>)
      This air's ruination to a garden, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. You put up a jolly good fight against it, then. My father's garden
      looks pretty mean compared with yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>shyly</i>). Well, sir, you see, your father will try and look
      after his himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Yes. He's awfully attached to his garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>with a touch of patronage</i>). And he doesn't do it badly&mdash;for
      an amateur, as you might say, but&mdash;well, he makes mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b> (<i>protestingly</i>). Jim!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Oh, that's all right, Mrs. Pilling. Dick keeping well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b> (<i>formally</i>). Oh, yes, thank you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I saw him outside as I came in. I fancied the little chap looked
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>gravely</i>). He does look pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Anything the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. No, sir, no... only this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>vaguely</i>). This?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. This room&mdash;living in one room and nothing but streets to run
      about in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. You can't keep a child inside, sir. 'Tisn't natural. The streets if
      it's fine and the stairs when it's wet out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. None too safe, Mrs. Pilling, either of 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. But what are you to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>hopelessly</i>). Nothing, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Folks can't thrive cramped up the way we are. If garden stuff won't
      go in the air, it can't be good for humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>A knock at the door. Without waiting for Sally, who starts towards
      door, Stephen Verity enters. He is fifty, iron grey, with a good deal of
      iron in his composition, though just now concerned more with the velvet
      glove than the mailed fist. A selfmade man, he is cynical, domineering,
      dryly humorous at times, an ugly customer if crossed, with a strong jaw
      and tightly closed lips. Dressed in morning coat and grey trousers with
      very square toed boots, turned down collar, black tie. His coat is good
      solid broadcloth, but the cut is palpably local.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Stephen</b> (<i>off</i>). Are ye in, Pilling? (<i>He enters and sees Walter.
      Sally and Walter rise&mdash;grimacing at Walter.</i>) Oh! (<i>He stops
      short in doorway.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>with deference nicely regulated some degrees lower than that he
      showed Walter</i>). Come in, Mr. Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>holding out hand</i>). How do you do, Mr. Verity?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>shaking hands and speaking with laboured politeness</i>). How do
      you do, Mr. Montgomery? (<i>Dropping his hand&mdash;sneeringly.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>He appropriates the wicker chair. Walter sits edgeways on the table.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't expect to find you here. What are you doing? Looking after their
      souls?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>pleasantly</i>). I dropped in for a chat and a smoke, before
      going on to keep my appointment at your house. What are you doing? (<i>Sits
      l. of table.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I'm looking after their bodies, only some of them won't see it.
      Pilling's a tough nut to crack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Not gathered him in yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. No, but I shall. He's one of your flock. It takes time to get hold of
      these fellows who come in from the country, (<i>spitefully</i>) where the
      squire and the parson spell omnipotence. He'll change his tune yet,
      though.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>shaking his head</i>). I'm not the changing sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>confidently</i>). You will be. A year or two more of this room
      and you'll be ripe for anything.

    <p>
      <b>Sally</b> (<i>lifting the tray</i>). We're ripe now for a change from this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Don't go, Mrs. Pilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. I can get my turn at the sink for washing up now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. That can wait. I want to ask you something.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b> (<i>replacing the tray</i>). Yes, sir? (<i>Sits r. of table.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>after brief pause</i>). Well, now, Mrs. Pilling, what would you
      say we need most in Carrington?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b> (<i>promptly</i>). Fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You've hit the nail on the head. Trust a woman to be sensible when
      health's at stake. I've a piece of news for you. There's talk of getting a
      recreation ground for Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>interested&mdash;sincerely</i>). Indeed! I hadn't heard. It's a
      most interesting thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. And about time too. (<i>Sits below fire.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>sentimentalizing</i>). Yes, you'll be able to take Mrs. Pilling
      down for a stroll on a summer's evening or a Sunday afternoon and watch
      little Dick play about on the soft grass breathing the fresh air and
      fancying yourselves back in the country again. No need to have Dick
      running about in the streets then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>curtly</i>). When?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well, nothing's settled yet, of course. I'm bringing it up at the
      next Council meeting and I've a backing on both sides. Alderman Verity's a
      power in Carrington, I don't mind telling you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. I don't know about your power, sir. What I'm wondering is how it 'ull
      strike my boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. It sounds excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>suspiciously</i>). And where might your land be, Mr. Verity?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Ah, that's a secret yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Um. Recreation ground two mile away's no use to my lad and you'll not
      find land nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. It'll not be five minutes from your door.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Walter turns interestedly from one to the other.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Then you'll have to burrow for it or hang it in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. No, we shan't. The land we have in view's built on at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Lots of good that 'ull do&mdash;turning people out of house and home
      to make a playing field, when houses are so scarce an' all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Yes. To my mind it's more housing accommodation that's most urgent
      here, Mr. Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. We'll get neither without we're helped. There'll be a lot of
      opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Surely not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Oh, yes, there will. We Progressives can't carry anything in the
      Council unless there's a big force of public opinion at our backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>confidently</i>). You won't lack that if you've a practicable
      plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>hotly</i>). Practicable! Nothing ever is practicable to some folk
      that means spending public money and putting up the rates. They're too
      shortsighted to see that a healthy town pays best in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>reasonably</i>). Still, such things as rates have to be
      considered, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>hotly</i>). Oh, yes. Consider the purses of the ratepayers and
      consider the health of the people and the danger of little children
      playing in the street and ask your religion which consideration weighs
      heaviest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>a little warmly</i>). Really, Mr. Verity, I needn't consult my
      religion. My common sense is sufficient to put me on your side&mdash;if
      you really are right in believing there can be two sides to such a
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Don't you make any doubt about that. There'll be two sides right
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Well, can <i>I</i> do anything? Will you accept my help?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes, yours&mdash;and yours, Pilling, and every man's who'll say a
      word for us.

      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>interrupting</i>). I'll tell you what the Polygon, is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>quietly</i>). It's my home, Mr. Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>with gusto</i>). Yes, it's the home of the leisured and
      privileged class of Carrington. It's five big houses with a kind of a
      square of tennis lawn in the middle of them and a great big garden behind
      each. It's the only apology for a breathing space we have and it's bang in
      the middle of the town. You've got great gates to it marked "private" and
      a lodge keeper to watch 'em and see none of the common herd get in to soil
      your sacred air by breathing it in their vulgar lungs. It's a shame and a
      scandal for the land to be wasted on you and it's not going to be wasted
      much longer.

      <b>Walter</b> (<i>without passion</i>). To the people who live there, it's&mdash;&mdash;-

    <p>

      get in the way of the thousands that live crowded up like rabbits outside?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. They happen to be able to afford it, Mr. Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>sarcastically</i>). Yes. They're well-to-do, so they've the right
      to monopolize the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>mildly</i>). Yes, yes. But you do put things so violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>glancing at Jim for approval</i>). I feel 'em violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>half apologetically</i>). You must remember this is quite a new
      idea to me, and for the moment it seems iconoclastic, if you don't mind my
      saying so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>sneering</i>). Yes. Like all your class, you don't like new
      ideas. I'll say nothing about your Church, though that don't like new
      things either.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Jim rises.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. If you'll only give me a moment to think, Mr. Verity.... I'm
      trying my best to see the matter from your standpoint. Meantime, I don't
      know that you'll improve things by fulminating against the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>blustering</i>). I shan't do myself any good by truckling to it,
      either. The Church was here before I was. It was here when Carrington was
      a little village and it's stood by and let the place grow into one huge
      slum. If we waited for the Church to give us a lead, we'd wait for all
      eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>smiling</i>). But you're not addressing the Church, you know.
      You're addressing a young and humble member of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You're all tarred with the same brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Not so black as our cloth, I hope. Some of us younger men try to
      be social reformers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes. It's all very pretty and romantic, but when it comes to anything
      that touches you personally like this does you're as bad as the greediest
      tithe grabbing pluralist that ever robbed a starving farmer of his&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>touching Stephen's arm</i>). Mr. Verity, I'm a man that's slow to
      anger. But I've this to tell you. Mr. Montgomery's a clergyman and you're
      saying things to him that aren't proper to be said and that I'll hot have
      said in my room. (<i>Shrewdly.</i>) And you're not going the right way to
      get my vote for your recreation ground either. .
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>alarmed</i>). I apologize, Pilling. (<i>Rises.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>satisfied</i>). Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>earnestly</i>). It's the wrongs of your class. I think of others,
      Pilling. I see what the motorman saw&mdash;streets crowded with little
      children, growing up in the gutter, playing in the dust&mdash;I can't help
      it. My tongue runs away with me when I think of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Say no more, Mr. Verity. You're probably right about the Polygon.
      I dare say we are out of place there, but you couldn't expect me to take
      your view the moment it's sprung on me.
    </p>
    <p>

      hopeless.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Man</b>. Have you got any floor space to let in this room, mate?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. No. (<i>Trying to close the door. The Man's foot keeps it open.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Man</b>. Don't shut the door in our face. I've got the money to pay for it.

    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Stephen crosses l.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Aye. Lots of rooms about here with two or three families in 'em. Some
      one 'ull take them in if they look long enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I know. It's appalling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. And ten acres in the Polygon with only five houses on 'em. (<i>Sits
      in armchair.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. All the more reason to build houses there and not waste it in
      playing fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Ah! So it is wasted now?
    </p>
    <p>

      to fire standing.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. That's good news, any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Don't count on me for much. But what I can do I will. I'm afraid I
      must go now. I've a call to make before I'm due at your house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Right. See you later.

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>sourly</i>). Good, is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. What else do you call it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>aggressively</i>). Look here, Mr. Verity, you've been coming here
      calling yourself my friend. I knew well enough it was my vote you were
      after. Bless you, I don't mind. I know what even the real gentry 'ull do
      to get a man's vote. I've seen Sir Charles himself stand by and watch his
      wife kiss our Dick at election time. But I've finished with you now.
      You'll come here no more after this. (<i>Above table l.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>staggered</i>). But... I don't understand. What have I done? (<i>Rises.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. It's not what you've done. It's what you're wanting to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I'm wanting to provide a recreation ground for Dick to play in.
      Anything wrong in that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. A lot. There's more important things than playing fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Oh, you're thinking of Montgomery's idea for houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. No, I'm not thinking of anybody's ideas. Thinking of ideas leads to
      mischief. I'm thinking of my bread and butter that you're taking from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. You know very well where I work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You're Mr. Vining's gardener, aren't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Yes, and Mr. Vining lives in the Polygon. It's likely I'd vote for
      breaking up the Polygon, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. But, my dear friend&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. I tell you I'm not your friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Mr. Vining will have to live somewhere. He won't cease to require a
      gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Ever hear tell as a bird in the hand whacked two in the bush?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>scornfully</i>). If you're afraid of losing your employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>with conviction</i>). A working man's always afraid of that. I
      know what it's like to be out of a job.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>ingratiatingly, after a slight pause</i>). Well, now, I tell you
      what.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>.. Aye?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. We shall want somebody to look after the grass in the recreation
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. The Park Committee will want an experienced gardener&mdash;like you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Are you offering me the job?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. How do you know you'll be on any Park Committee? You might be fired
      out of the Council next November.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>with dignity</i>). I'm an alderman, Pilling. Aldermen stay in,
      they don't get fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. You're offering me this. Well and good. And what about all the other
      folk as find work in the Polygon? House servants and such like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. The residents won't cease to want servants where they move to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. And you can flit servants same as furniture, can't you? And servants
      haven't votes and I have. So you bribe me and they can go to the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>backing in alarm</i>). Mr. Pilling!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Oh, I'm not blind, if I was brought up in the country. They didn't
      learn me there to vote against my master, either. I take Mr. Vining's
      money and&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. But man alive, how's he to know which way you vote? The ballot's
      secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>sceptically</i>). Oh, aye, we've heard that tale before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>irritated</i>). But it is secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>unconvinced</i>). That's what they tell you. And if it is, it's
      not secret from me. I'd know how I voted. And I couldn't hold out my hand
      for wages from a man when I'd voted opposite to him. I'm not built that
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>disgustedly</i>). Jim Pilling, I thought you'd more sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. I've a sense of right and wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes, the sense that your employer's always right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. It makes no matter if he's right or wrong. He's still my employer. A
      man can't vote against the gentleman that gives him bread and butter, and
      Mr. Vining's a real gentleman, mind you. (<i>With enthusiastic admiration</i>).
      I never saw him raise his hand to do a thing himself yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You're a fool, Pilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. I'm an honest fool, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Look here, if you won't take it from me, will you take it from Mr.
      Montgomery?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. I don't know. He's a young 'un. More like a man than a parson. Coming
      in here and smoking his pipe like you might do yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. But he is a parson&mdash;young Montgomery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>grudgingly</i>). Aye. He's a man I trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Then if he tells you, will you vote for turning the Polygon into a
      playing ground?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b> (<i>confidently</i>). He won't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. But if he does?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. I'll see.

    <p>
      (<i>Dick doesn't respond. Exit Stephen.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. Good riddance and all. Now, Dick, you ought to have been in bed
      long ago. (<i>Takes Dick up to bed.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dick</b>. Can't I come and watch you wash up?

    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. No, you can't. (<i>She begins to undress him.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dick</b>. I want my supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. You can have it in bed.

    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. You don't like Verity, lass?
    </p>
    <p>

      We're not his class.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. Vote's what he's after, and it's a marvel to me what they will do for
      votes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sally</b>. You'll do yourself no good with him, Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jim</b>. I'm thinking so myself. He's a bit too keen on this recreation
      ground, Verity is. Been putting himself about something extraordinary. (<i>Crosses
      to fireplace, taking pipe.</i>) I fancy, you know, there's, something
      behind all this.

    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. What do you want to get married for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I'm in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. That's no reason. You curates, you're all alike&mdash;must be with
      marrying other folk so much. Infectious, I reckon. Church ought to be
      scheduled along with the other dangerous trades.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. You're laughing at me.

    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Yes. (<i>Sits r. of table.</i>)
    </p>

      have enormous families on no income. (<i>Walter makes an attempt to
      protest; Stephen proceeds unmoved.</i>) I advise you not to marry him. If
      he wants a wife, he'll not go begging one for long. There's always crowds
      of silly girls ready to help a chap to button his collar behind.

      <b>Walter</b>. Mr. Verity, this isn't a joke to us.

    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I don't know that losing Lucy 'ud be a joke to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I can very well believe that. But it's a thing that's bound to
      come to you sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You're making a mistake. It isn't bound to come at all. My daughter's
      no need to find a man to keep her. She's a head on her shoulders and sense
      enough to know when she's well off. Who's going to look after my house if
      Lucy marries? Tell me that, young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I really haven't thought about it, Mr. Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. And I'm not going to.
    </p>
    <p>

      get married to-morrow.

      <b>Walter</b> (<i>with excessive dignity</i>). I'm not without money, sir. I
      could afford to marry at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Could you now? And what might you call being not without money?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I've ¬£150 a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You plutocrat! Lucy, do you hear that? He's ¬£150 a year. Nice sort of
      marrying income, that is. Oh, but perhaps I'm wronging you. What's your
      father going to do for you when you marry?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I don't know. I haven't asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well, give a guess at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Nothing, probably. He gave me an expensive education.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Then he made a bad investment if it's only worth ¬£150 a year to you
      to-day. I had no education and I'm worth&mdash;well, never mind. Lucy,
      tell him what I've been telling you to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. What you told me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Don't repeat my words like a fool. Go on. You've got your chance of
      talking now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. But&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. So like a woman to be backward at tongue-wagging, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b> (<i>as if repeating a lesson</i>). You told me that mother left me
      money which you've, increased by investment till it's now capable of
      yielding ¬£1,000 a year, and since my twenty-first birthday a week ago the
      money lies to my credit at the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. That's right. Now, my gallant ¬£3 a weeker, what have you got to say
      to that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Of course I didn't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. No. I'll gamble you didn't. You fancied I lived in a small house
      because I couldn't afford a big 'un. That's a regular Polygon notion.
      You're used to their way of living up to your income and as much beyond as
      you've pluck for. When a man's worked as hard as I have he don't spend as
      fast as he earns. He sticks to what he's got.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I knew you were a successful man, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I've made my way. I began low and I'm no class now, bar what they
      think of me at the bank&mdash;and that's a fat lot more than they think of
      any fine Polygon gentlemen. Would you like to know where Lucy's bit comes
      from?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Really, I'm&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Her grandfather kept the <i>Black Bull</i>. That's where it was made,
      except what I've added to it. Stinks of beer, that money does. Pubs were a
      good thing in his time for a landlord that kept off the drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I've no doubt it was honestly made.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Aye, ye <i>would</i> think that now you fancy your chance of
      fingering it. It was made in the way of business same as my own was, and
      that means the best man won and he hadn't time to stand still and think
      about honesty. Too busy downing the other fellow for that. And now you've
      got it. That's me, sir, builder and contractor, and married a publican's
      daughter. Feeling as keen set on Lucy as you were?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I don't believe very much in artificial class distinctions, Mr.
      Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Don't you? Not in your business hours, you mean. Not so long as you
      remember you're a parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Father! (<i>Rises.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well, what's the matter with you? Do you want to marry him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You're a fool. You've ¬£1,000 a year. You're an heiress. He's a
      pauper..
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I'm not a pauper, but I quite agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the worldly point of view&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. It's the only view I care-about. (<i>To Lucy.</i>) With your money
      you can look high.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Thanks, father. When I want to buy a husband, I'll let you know. I'm
      thinking of marrying one at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>immensely surprised</i>). Hullo! Showing spirit, are you? (<i>Rises.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. It's the first time, if I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. And it had better be the last, if you don't want to quarrel. I'm not
      one of these weak-kneed modern fathers that let themselves be browbeaten
      by their own children. Perhaps you think you'll get him whether I consent
      or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. I hope you will consent. (<i>Pause.</i>),
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I'm not fond of curates, Lucy. It's a soft job, and a real man looks
      for a fighting chance in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I get plenty of fighting to do, Mr. Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Who do you fight with?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Evil, in every shape and form.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. 'Um, the devil's game for a few rounds yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. He's an old hand, and if we haven't knocked him out we're
      weakening his defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well, I'll give you a chance of showing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. In a good cause, I hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. The cause is all right. You're a parson. Got the good of the poor at
      heart and all that sort of thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I hope so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes. (<i>Briskly.</i>) Well now, about Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Is that the fight?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I'm coming to the fight. You say you love her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I do. (<i>Stephen is between them.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>to Lucy</i>). You love him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Yes. (<i>Lucy r., Stephen c., Walter l.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>holding up his hands evenly</i>). Quits so far. Income on the
      male side ¬£150 a year. (<i>Surveys his right hand.</i>) Income on the
      female side ¬£1,000. (<i>Depressing his left hand as if weighing the
      incomes in scales.</i>) Hullo! wo! something wrong there. Doesn't balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>bitterly</i>). Do you think I don't know it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>dropping his hands</i>). Yes. You've hooked your fish, my boy.
      But you're a long way off landing her yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Tell me what you want me to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>curtly</i>). Earn her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Yes, but how? (<i>Steps forward.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. By fighting. By doing something for the good of the town. There's
      this proposal to buy up the Polygon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>eagerly</i>). Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well, now you know what you've to do. You know what Polygon people
      are and you know what the town needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. The town needs space and decent houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. That's what you've to rub into your Polygon set, and you'll not find
      'em seeing it so easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. You can't blame them if they don't exactly welcome the idea of
      turning out and making fresh homes in their old age. It's only natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Oh, I'm not afraid of them. They'll not stop us. All you've to do is
      to make them see they're an obstacle to progress in this town. They're
      bound to see justice if they are narrow and selfish and too puffed up with
      pride to know the townspeople and&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. And they're my father and my friends, Mr. Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes, I knew you only disbelieved in class distinctions during
      business hours. Scratch the curate and find the hypocrite.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>keeping his temper smilingly</i>). As bad as all that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. The moment I attack your class you're up in arms to defend 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. No. They take up too much room in the Polygon. I never said they
      didn't. But they'll not want to go. And surely the whole thing depends on
      Sir Charles' readiness to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes, but a willing Polygon will make a lot of difference, and if you
      want Lucy as bad as you say, here's your way to help yourself to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I don't see what Lucy has to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Well, do you? The town proposes to buy the Polygon for the people.
      It's an excellent project and my plain duty is to further it. I shan't
      fail in my duty merely because of the unpleasant unheaval in the lives of
      a few people who happen to be dear to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Oh! Well, I don't want words, I want deeds. Succeed and I'll think
      about calling you son-in-law&mdash;if Lucy doesn't change her mind
      meantime.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I can't see why you insist on making a kind of bribe of Lucy when
      there's only one course open to me in any case.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>grimly</i>). I'm making sure of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Father, you don't doubt&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I always doubt an untried man. I doubt if he'll have the pluck to
      face old Vining in the Polygon&mdash;I doubt lots of things. Put it that
      I'm giving him some Dutch courage to stiffen his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>desperately</i>). I don't want Dutch courage. Is there any way
      of convincing you that I mean what I say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. There's going and doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Very well, I will. (<i>Moving as if to go.</i>) Ste. (<i>stopping
      him</i>). Remember, you're not engaged to Lucy yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I understand. (<i>Crosses r.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. That'll do, then. You know what you've to do. Good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Yes. Good-night, Mr. Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Lucy moves towards right door.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>to Lucy</i>). You stay where you are. Say good-night to him while
      I've got my eye on you. He can find the front door without your help.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Lucy and Walter shake hands, R.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Exit Walter, r. A slight pause. Stephen eyes Lucy from head to foot
      before speaking. Lucy crosses and sits l. of table.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>before fire, judicially</i>). It strikes me pretty forcibly I've
      brought a fool into the world. (<i>Sharply.</i>) How long's this been
      going on behind my back?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b> (<i>with an air of standing up to him</i>). Nothing's gone on behind
      your back. I told Walter at once he must speak to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Umph! If you'd told me you wanted help to send him about his business
      there'd have been some sense in it. But you backed him up. You showed,
      fight. You're getting proud, my girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. I've grown up, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Grown up, have you? All right. If you fancy you're too old to come to
      me for advice you can do without.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. You know I want your advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. So as you can do opposite, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Oh, that's unjust, father. I never disobeyed you in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>, And you'd better not begin now, or you and I will fall out. Ha! So
      you're grown up, are you? Yes, you've been a legal woman for a week. Only
      I've been a legal man for thirty years and you'll allow I know the world
      better than you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Oh, you do agree to that, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well, I tell you you'll be throwing yourself away on young
      Montgomery..(<i>Persuasively.</i>) He's not up to your weight, Lucy.
      Polygon type, he is. You know, shove all your goods in the shop window.
      Live in a big house for swank and get it dirt cheap because the
      neighbourhood's gone down. They're not solid.. Lucy, you and I together
      could buy up the whole, crowd of swells to-morrow..
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. I fell in love with Walter before I knew I'd a penny piece in the
      world. I don't think my money must make any difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Don't be silly. Money makes all differences. We're all born without
      pockets. It's pockets or no pockets that makes us rich or poor. Yesterday
      you didn't knew you'd a pocket and the Polygon looked big and young
      Montgomery, he looked big. I don't blame you. It looked a good thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. It looks the same to-day as it did yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Women are fools over money. I did think <i>you'd</i> more sense. (<i>Dogmatically.</i>)
      Money should, marry money. (<i>With rising irritation.</i>) It's all my
      eye to talk of throwing away your money on a penniless curate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b> (<i>rises</i>). I'm sorry to disagree. Obedience has its limits. I
      hope we shan't quarrel, father, but I'm a free woman now and I warn you&mdash;oh,
      I'm sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Sorry, are you? I'm a hard man, Lucy. I'm a masterful man. I know
      that. But I'm a soft-hearted fool where you're concerned, or I'd let you
      marry the curate and suffer the consequences. But I've got ambitions for
      you if you've none for yourself. (<i>R.d.</i>) When you marry there's two
      things for it&mdash;money or birth&mdash;and you'll not find either in
      Polygon. They're a bad imitation of the real thing&mdash;about as near as
      the shoddy Bamford makes it to honest broadcloth. Not one of them with a
      handle to his name. (<i>Crosses to Lucy.</i>) If you must get married,
      I'll find you a husband. Leave it to me. And don't be in such a hurry to
      leave your old dad if you are a free woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b> (<i>quietly</i>). I'm marrying Walter Montgomery, father; but we're
      not in any hurry.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

      till I've put the business through.

      <b>Alcorn</b>. Why, this. (<i>Reading the letter.</i>) "Speaking for myself
      alone, I consider it extremely improbable that Sir Charles will consent to
      a sale of the Polygon to your company." (<i>Leaves letter on the table.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. There's nothing to be afraid of there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b>. I don't know so much about that. These land owning fellows know
      they're no good at business. They leave it to their agents, and if the
      agent writes like that, you can take it he knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. He knows all right. Sir Charles isn't a business man, but his agent
      is. If there's a chance of selling, that agent wants a top price;
      naturally he writes that way to bluff us into raising our offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. You've a head on your shoulders, Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>to Bamford</i>). It all depends on what you told us. If your
      information's correct, they'll be only too glad to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b>. Yes. It's you that told us Sir Charles is in low water.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. He's dropped a pot of money lately. It's a well known fact. I
      know one bookie that's taken ten thousand off him in the season, and he's
      not the only one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b> (<i>sanctimoniously</i>). Deplorable wastrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Eh? Oh, aye! (<i>Ironically.</i>) Lamentable prodigality. Shocking
      extravagance, isn't it, Alcorn?
    </p>
    <p>
      But it suits our book. The faster he goes the pace the better for us, so
      you might as well be decently grateful instead of getting mealy mouthed
      over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. Me and Alcorn were arguing coming along here what's to be done
      with the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b>. Aye, but as I told him, the first thing is to get possession of
      the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Now, don't you worry about that, Alcorn. The land's as good as ours
      at our own price. Sir Charles 'ull jump at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. Well, I'm for building on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b>. And I'm not so sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. Of course you're on my side, Verity?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Your side?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. For building.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. What, and you a builder!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I've finished building now. I'm getting old. I've made my money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b>. I'm out for making an open space of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. You're a blooming philanthropist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. No, he's not. It's a pity you missed our last meeting. You don't
      grasp the idea yet. We buy the land from Sir Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Then we create a demand in the town for a recreation ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b>. And you back it up in the Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. And Alcorn as borough surveyor approves officially.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b>. We force the town to buy from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. And get a quick return of our capital with a clinking profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b> (<i>obstinately</i>), Well, I thought it was houses. Houses are
      safe, and you'd easier raise a cry for houses than playing fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Depends how you go about it. Work it proper and you could get them
      yelling like kids for a municipal service of flying machines.

    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b>. Sorry I'm late, but I've been employing my time well. Sowing the
      seed.
    </p>

      <b>Ste</b>. Been getting at the voters?
    </p>

      (<i>Smithson sits between Alcorn and Stephen.</i>) Smiths. Yes, one or
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You've been wasting time. I've collared a man who'll bring in voters
      by the score.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b>. Who might that be, Mr. Verity?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Young Montgomery. The parson lad. For all their talk, the Church
      still has a big hold on the poorer classes. It'll pay to have that boy on
      our side. He'll talk to them in the Polygon, too. Bamford. Aye. Good man,
      that, Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>to Smithson</i>). There's a letter you'd better read.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Smithson reads it.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b> (<i>sullenly; emerging from a silent sulk</i>). I thought it was
      houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well, it isn't. It 'ud take too much capital to cover the Polygon
      with houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. It was houses. You've altered it. I ought to have been told. No
      one told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b> (<i>looking up from the letter</i>). He'll come round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b> (<i>taking it personally; indignantly</i>). Who'll come round? I
      won't come round. Houses it was and houses it's going to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>moving Smithson to give Alcorn the letter. Alcorn pockets it.
      Dryly.</i>) We spoke of Sir Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b>, (<i>tentatively</i>). I fancy, myself, houses would be a safer
      battle-cry with the people, Mr. Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Damn the people. Who cares for the people?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b> (<i>rising</i>). I really must protest. Such language! (<i>He seems
      genuinely shocked.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>impatiently</i>). It's so silly to talk as if the people
      mattered. Government by the people! Any fool can lead 'em where he wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b> (<i>sitting</i>). We must consider their feelings a bit. Think of
      the rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Oh, we'll consider their feelings all right. We must make 'em feel
      what we want 'em to feel.. Then they'll vote for what we want and kid
      themselves we do it for their sake. That's how to consider their feelings.
      When I was a lad there was a trout stream ran through Carrington. It's a
      sewer now, but there were trout in it then and I've caught 'em by tickling
      their bellies. That's the way to catch voters, Mr. Alcorn. Tickle 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b>. Yes, but the trout died. The voter lives to vote next time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Go on tickling. I'm an old hand and I've never known it fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. You're not attending to me. I say houses. Smithson says houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b> (<i>in alarm</i>). Oh, no, I don't. Indeed I don't. I only say
      houses 'ull bring votes quicker than playing fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b>. I suppose you couldn't shout houses and make it the other thing
      afterwards?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b>. I'm surprised at you, Mr. Alcorn. (<i>Very righteously.</i>) I
      stand for purity in municipal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. Yes. Always be honest with your electors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Alcorn's got none. He's a permanent official with a certain job, or
      he'd know better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. If I provide a quarter of the capital, I've a right&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You've every right, Mr. Bamford, and we shall do nothing without your
      approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. Then I approve houses. As a ratepayer&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b> (<i>grudgingly</i>). No, we can't do without Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Our share of what 'ull go on the rates is a flea bite. Our profit
      'ull cover it a hundred times. I don't deny the town needs houses, needs
      'em badly, only I haven't the capital for houses. My money's tied up and
      I'm not touching it. The money I'm putting into this isn't my own.

      allowance, you know. Needn't spend above half of it.

    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. To tell you the truth, Sam, I'm not struck on the idea of losing her
      at all. But she's got a fancy in her head and it's one I don't cotton to.
      Best cure might be to put you there instead and be sure of her not making
      a fool of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. Then I'm not too late. (<i>Sits again.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You're the best man up to now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. Well&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. See here, Sam. It's like this. That girl can look high. Question is,
      are you high enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. Which way?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. Depends what you call high.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes... (<i>half apologetically.</i>) I've a right to know before I
      put it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b> (<i>after slight hesitation</i>). Well, I'll tell you this: you
      know what my father left?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. There's more to-day. (<i>They exchange looks.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>rising with resolution</i>). That 'ull do. (<i>Opens left door.</i>)
      Lucy, come back a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b> (<i>rises in alarm</i>). I'm not what you call a parlour ladies'
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I'll stand by you.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter Lucy.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now then. (<i>Crosses r.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. You want me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>indicating Bamford</i>). He does.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b> (<i>awkwardly</i>). Yes, I do, Miss Verity. That's just what I do.
      I want you.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Lucy is puzzled.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>looking at her</i>). Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b> (<i>turning from one to the other</i>). You want me. I'm here. What
      do you want me for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b> (<i>l.</i>). For better or for worse. (<i>Giggling genially.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b> (<i>freezing</i>). I don't understand you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>roughly</i>). Don't play stupid now. You understand him well
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. But&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Looking appealingly at Stephen.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Here's your chance, my girl. Here's your answer to the other fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. I have given him my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well, you can give, Mr.. Bamford his and say yes. He's got money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b> (<i>eagerly</i>). Yes, I've got money and I spend it. I'll give
      you the time of your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Don't spoil this evening for me, Mr. Bamford. You've made me so
      happy, so grateful to you all for letting me help in your charity. I only
      knew to-night how rich I am. It frightened me&mdash;the thought of so much
      money. I was afraid of it... of my unworthiness. Until you showed me the
      way to use it well. I was proud that I... and now... father, this isn't
      fair of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. What isn't fair?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Why didn't you tell Mr. Bamford? (<i>To Bamford.</i>) I'm engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>r.c.</i>). Don't lie. You're not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b> (<i>bravely</i>). I choose to consider myself engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. He's a pauper. Look here, my girl, you're rebellious to-night. I'm
      master here. I'm not the sort of fool to let you twist me round your
      little finger. Don't think because you're twenty-one and got a thousand a
      year (<i>the sum moves Bamford visibly</i>) that you'll ride rough-shod
      over me. (<i>More gently.</i>) You've got to be sensible. (<i>Smacks
      table.</i>) You've got to do what I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. You shall have your carriage and dress yourself as much as you
      like; and what's more, marry me and you'll be. Mayoress of Carrington in
      November.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Wait a minute, Bamford, not so fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. What's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>crossing l.</i>). Engaged, if you like, but no wedding till the
      Polygon deal's complete. The profits on that are mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. Of course they are. I'll hand over your share when we've sold to
      the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Sold! Profit! I thought&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Never mind what you thought. (<i>Goes up to Lucy.</i>) That wasn't
      meant for your ears. You'd better go back to the other room now. I'll talk
      to you after Mr. Bamford's gone. (<i>Indicating her to exit.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. I hope. Mr. Bamford will remember I'm engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. He'll remember you're going to be&mdash;to him. (<i>Crosses down r.
      above, table.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Father, I've obeyed you long enough. I'm twenty-one now, and I'm
      going to take my own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b> (<i>doubtfully</i>). I don't like the look of this, Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Look of what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b>. She's a bit of a Tartar, isn't she?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. That's nothing to what I can do when I'm roused, Mr. Bamford.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Pssh! It's the first time she's broken out like this. She'll be tame
      enough next time you come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b> (<i>viciously</i>). Don't make too sure of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I'm not afraid of that. It's a pity if a man can't do as he likes
      with his own flesh and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bamford</b> (<i>warily</i>). Best sleep on it before you say more, Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>going to Lucy</i>): Yes. Go to bed, Lucy, and say over to
      yourself, I'm going to marry Mr. Bamford. Then you'll get used to the
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. But I'm not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Aren't you? We'll see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Yes, we will. (<i>At exit l.</i>)

      ACT III
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Archibald Vining's house in the Polygon the following afternoon. The
      room is large and lofty with the air of serene mellowness common to old
      houses. The door is r., behind the large mantelpiece. Behind is a French
      window, beyond which the-garden is seen. The room is panelled; its
      incidental trappings suggest occupants hardly able to live up to their
      surroundings; the furniture is faded; the carpet worn. Walter sits on a
      chair to the r. of the window against the wall. Down l. is his father
      Augustus Montgomery at an escritoire. On a large settee placed crosswise
      l. sit Mrs. Montgomery and Mrs. Vining. Archibald Vining is posed with an
      elbow on the mantelpiece, looking across at Montgomery. The ladies gaze at
      him with admiration. Montgomery Senior is sixty, rather bald, weak-faced,
      futile, dressed in light grey morning coat and trousers. Vining is ruddy,
      irascible, with white moustache and grey hair, in black morning coat and
      grey trousers. The women are both rather foolish. Mrs. Montgomery is stout
      and Mrs. Vining lean, but there is otherwise not much to choose between
      them in age, which is about fifty, or anything else. Their dress is
      conventional without being fashionable or expensive. They live next door
      and Mrs. Montgomery has come in without a hat. The light is of a sunny
      afternoon and there is no fire. Marjorie Vining, a tall athletic girl,
      sits by the window c., with a tennis racket, looking, increasingly bored.</i>

      <b>Vining</b> (<i>dictating</i>). "Your rumoured intention to sell the Polygon"&mdash;got
      that, Montgomery?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Montgomery</b>. Yes. (<i>Looking up timidly.</i>) Excuse me, Vining, I can't
      help saying it again, but are you quite sure we form a quorum?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>assertively</i>). Of course we do, my dear fellow. Don't distress
      yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. (<i>desperately</i>). But&mdash;but there are five houses in the
      Polygon and only two are represented here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. We know the views of the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. Vin</b>. Their views are ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Quite so. Allow for unavoidable absentees, and your scruples vanish.
      Shall I proceed?

    <p>
      (<i>Montgomery writes at intervals, when others talk.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. Archibald, have we any right to be indignant with Sir Charles?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. We <i>are</i> indignant, aren't we?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. Yes. But will Sir Charles quite like us to tell him so?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>, (<i>pathetically</i>). It's deucedly&mdash;beg pardon&mdash;it's
      hard to be diplomatic. How would "protest meeting" do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Too political. Let "indignation" stand. We must show him he's roused
      the sleeping lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>, (<i>acquiescent</i>). I'll underline it if you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. No! No! Firmness, my dear Monty, firmness, not ostentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. M</b>. (<i>gushingly to Mrs. Vining</i>). What a man of affairs Mr.
      Vining is!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>filling his chest</i>). I flatter myself I put things through,
      Mrs. Montgomery. Now, Monty!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. (<i>reading</i>). "At the indignation meeting&mdash;um&mdash;held on
      the&mdash;um&mdash;it was resolved to respectfully address&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>reprovingly</i>). Well, Cecilia?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>, (<i>puzzled</i>). That's in order, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Quite. Go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. But, Archibald, to address a split infinitive to a baronet!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. I stand corrected. Thanks, Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. I don't quite see&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>moving him to write</i>). It was resolved respectfully to address&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>, (<i>correcting and reading</i>). To address a letter to you on the
      subject of your rumoured intention to sell the Polygon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Correct, I think? (<i>Approval from the settee.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. (<i>proceeding</i>). It is our hope that should this information be
      correct, bracket, which we hesitate to believe, bracket, you will
      reconsider your decision to give over to the hands of the jerry builder
      the only residences in Carrington habitable by persons of refinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Excellent. (<i>Approval from settee. Vining crosses l. to above
      Montgomery and takes letter; patronisingly.</i>) You write a clerkly hand,
      Monty. (<i>Picks up pen.</i>) I'll sign as the oldest resident present.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Montgomery swallows a protest, remaining seated, Vining signs, bending
      over.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      What a pity Sir Charles is abroad. We shall be kept waiting for his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. You got his address from Dunkerly?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>putting envelope before him</i>). Yes. <i>Hotel M√©tropole</i>,
      Monte Carlo.

      (<i>Montgomery writes and encloses letter. Vining goes to French window
      and opens it.</i>)

    <p>
      I'll have this posted at once. (<i>Calls.</i>) Pilling!

    <p>
      (<i>He returns. Montgomery crosses r. and sits above fireplace.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. Ah, well! That's settled..
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>sitting at desk</i>). Yes.
    </p>
    <p>

      tennis, Walter. (<i>Puts chair down c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Not this afternoon, Marjorie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Oh, be a sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Some other time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. It's always some other time with you, now. I'm forgetting what you
      look like in flannels. You'll lose all your form if you don't practice a
      bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I'm afraid I must let it go. (<i>Rises and crosses l.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. It's pure slacking. Don't be so beastly serious, if you are in
      Orders. Come and be a muscular Christian on the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Something more serious to-day, Marjorie. Mar. Oh, rot! What's the
      good of having the courts if you don't use 'em?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. They certainly might be used more by you young people.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. They might be used by hundreds of people if&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mar</b>. Oh, blow, you're getting on your hobby horse again. I'm going to
      practice putting if you won't give me a game. You are a rotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Exit Marjorie c. to l. Pilling appears c. from l. in his
      shirt-sleeves.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>closes desk and crosses up l.c.</i>). Oh, Pilling, just post this
      letter at once. Are your hands clean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pilling</b> (<i>inspecting his very black hands</i>). Not very, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Go and wash them and come back for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pilling</b>. Yes, sir.

    <p>
      (<i>Pilling vanishes to r. Vining crosses to fire.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. M</b>. I can't understand Sir Charles wanting to sell at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. No. What would Carrington be without the Polygon?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>quietly</i>). I'm not sure that it wouldn't be a good deal
      better off, Mrs. Vining.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>They all stare at him astonished.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. What an extraordinary thing to say. Why, we <i>are</i> Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. We've always lived in the Polygon. We've taken root, Carrington's
      gone on its way&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. A precious bad way, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. Other times, other manners, Vining.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Carrington has no manners&mdash;but the Polygon has stood aloof.
      Thank God we leisured people have no connection with the town roughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Then how can you say you <i>are</i> Carrington?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. We are the best people in Carrington, sir. Do you judge a place by
      its quality or by the counting of heads?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I wish I could make you see their point of view, Mr. Vining.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>snorting</i>). Their point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>quietly</i>). They have one, you know. Before that letter goes
      to Sir Charles, I'd like to try&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. M. Walter</b>, remember what the Polygon means to all of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. It's a survival, mother. It's out of date in the midst of a modern
      manufacturing town.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>, (<i>pathetically</i>). But&mdash;but, Walter, it means so
      tremendously much to us all. It may be out of date, but I did hope it was
      going to last our time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. It's <i>got</i> to last our time. (<i>Sincerely.</i>) I'm not a
      deeply religious man, but I get reverent when I think of the Polygon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. M</b>. That's just it. We all love the Polygon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. The five houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. Chatsworth.

    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. Apsley House.

    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. Are we to lose it <i>all?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>with appropriate chest expansion</i>). Not if Archibald Vining
      can prevent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. You make it very hard for me to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Then don't go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. (<i>crosses c.</i>). I must. Father, Mr. Vining, you&mdash;all of
      you&mdash;are wrapped up in the Polygon. You hardly go out of it except to
      the station. |
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. There's nothing else in Carrington to go to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Thank goodness we've no business to take us into those mean streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. You haven't, Mr. Vining, but I have. I see the other side of the
      picture, if you don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Well, my dear boy, every town has its back stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>sits c.</i>). Carrington's all back stairs, and cramped stairs
      they are. There's no breathing space. What right have we to monopolize the
      air? We've room to move about&mdash;so much room that you need never go
      out of the Polygon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. We pay for the privilege, don't we?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Yes, you pay for it in money and they pay for the lack of it in
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. If there's overcrowding it's a matter for the town authorities to
      deal with.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. They want to deal with it. They want the Polygon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. They can't have it. They must know it 'ud be cutting off their nose
      to spite their face. The Polygon's essential to Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. It <i>is</i> Carrington. I tell you this, young man, Carrington's
      last state would be worse than its first if you took us away. We&mdash;we
      circulate money. We give the place a tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. It's a tone the place could do without. It could do without your
      money. We are not Carrington. The factories are the essential Carrington.
      Mr. Vining, (<i>rising and taking a step to r. c.</i>) let me show you
      what it's like&mdash;whole families living&mdash;no, not living&mdash;pigging
      in a single room. Rooms cut up amongst two or three families. All in
      Carrington, our neighbours in Christian Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Thanks. I'm not the sort of man to put my head into a noose. I prefer
      to keep out of infection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>appealingly</i>). Don't send that letter to Sir Charles. Don't
      try to influence his decision. The workpeople can't move out of the town.
      They must live near their work. You can move. Dividends can reach you
      anywhere just as easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. Move of ourselves! Never!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. M. Walter</b>, you don't understand what you're asking us to do. You're
      young. You can change easily, because you're young and restless. But when
      you've lived in a house that's dear to you till it's become part of your
      life, you can't leave it in your old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Walter crosses above settee.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. I can't leave my garden. You know that. No other garden would mean
      the same to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. My dear friends, you needn't worry. Carrington would never let us go.
      Walter's got hold of the wrong end of the stick. We're an institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. How do you know? Did you ever ask them what they think of us?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. I'll ask Pilling. You'll see. (<i>Crosses up c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I shouldn't advise you to. I know Pilling's home. He's a wife and
      child. They all live in one room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Why, I pay the man twenty-two shillings a week. What does he live
      like that for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. He's no choice. Pilling 'ull tell you what Carrington thinks of
      the Polygon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. He's a long time washing his hands. (<i>Goes up to window and looks
      off r.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. But you're not going to send that letter now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Certainly we are. (<i>Returns r.c.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. But&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. I think we're all agreed on that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Quite. No stone unturned. That fellow who's coming, what's his name&mdash;you
      know, Walter&mdash;that alderman&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Verity?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Verity. That's it. We must make sure of the town authorities. A
      little affability goes a long way with people of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. Yes. He's not the type of man you're accustomed to meet in my
      drawing-room, Mrs. Montgomery, still&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. It's in a good cause, Mrs. Vining.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. M</b>. He's an architect, isn't he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. He's a builder who's his own architect. That's why his houses fall
      to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. M</b>. That's what I say. An architect. Almost a professional man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. But you mustn't pin your faith on Verity. He's, the last man&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Walter, as a Churchman, I am always willing to accept your views on
      religious matters. But when it comes to worldly questions, permit me to
      have an opinion of my own.

    <p>
      (<i>Up to Pilling, who turns to go.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      One moment, Pilling, I want to ask you something. Can you tell me how
      people in the town talk of the Polygon?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pilling</b>. How they talk, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Yes. What's the general opinion of us? Pilling. It's not for the
      likes of me to talk against the gentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. They <i>do</i> talk against us, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pilling</b> (<i>awkwardly</i>). Well, sir&mdash;&mdash;- (<i>He pauses.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>helping him out</i>). Tell them how you live, Pilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pilling</b>. You can tell that as well as me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>impatiently</i>). Yes, yes, but that's not the point. Doesn't
      your class feel what a privilege it is to have us living in your midst?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pilling</b> (<i>earnestly</i>). <i>I'd</i> be badly off without you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. You'd be sorry to lose us, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Of course <i>he</i> would. A gardener's no use if there's nothing
      to garden. Only Carrington's not a garden city. It's a manufacturing town.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. (<i>with back to fire, to Pilling</i>). Supposing now you weren't a
      gardener?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Yes. What's the common view of us?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pilling</b>. Well, sir, it 'ud seem to me against nature if the town had no
      quality in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>turning triumphantly to Walter</i>). You see? (<i>Patronising
      Pilling.</i>) You're perfectly right, Pilling. I've noticed it before. (<i>Talking
      at the ladies.</i>) The masses always have this instinctive clinging to
      their superiors. They know we're the source of all prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pilling</b> (<i>shyly</i>). There's queer talk, sometimes, sir. <i>I</i> know
      gentlemen are different from us, but there's men in this town wanting to
      tell me we're all born equal&mdash;asking your pardon, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. You know better than that, Pilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pilling</b>. Yes, mum.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. You could never get on without us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pilling</b>. No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Be honest, man. No one's going to hurt you for it. Tell us the
      truth, about the overcrowding and the waste of valuable space in the
      Polygon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. Yes. Tell us the truth, Pilling, and say you know how necessary we
      are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pilling</b>. You're bread and butter to me, mum, and I know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. There you are, Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>impatiently</i>). But he's an exception. He's
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>interrupting</i>). You've got the letter, Pilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pilling</b>. Yes, sir. (<i>Turning, then courageously.</i>) There's no denying
      as the overcrowding's something cruel. I wouldn't say a word of it, not to
      you, sir, if I didn't know and see and suffer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Montgomery sits again below fire.</i>)
    </p>

      <b>Pilling</b>. Yes, sir. (<i>Turns to go.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>

      you wait? Wait till Verity's been. You'll catch the same post.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now come to business, Mr. Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. What we want to see you about is this confounded rumour of the
      Polygon's being up for sale for building lots. No doubt you've heard it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I've heard tell of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Have you thought about it at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I've thought a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. Well, what do you think, Mr. Verity? Could anything be more absurd?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>nodding his head towards Walter</i>). Ask him. He knows what I
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Mr. Verity's of my opinion, father. Vin. We don't want your
      opinion, sir. You're full up with all sorts of idiotic modern
      sentimentalism about the poor. It all comes of the Church meddling with
      secular matters instead of minding its own business. Mr. Verity's a man of
      sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Thank you; but I don't know that I can do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. M</b>. (<i>sweetly</i>). Oh, but I'm sure you can, Mr. Verity. You've
      such influence in the town. You're a man of weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. If I am, madam, what had the town to do with Sir Charles selling the
      Polygon?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. How can the town get on without the Polygon?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. M</b>. I'm sure you, as an architect, Mr. Verity, must feel the
      importance of preserving such fine examples as these are of old Georgian
      mansions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. So many links with the historic past.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>impatiently</i>). It 'ud be a blue ruin for the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. Sheer catastrophe. You're a leading personage here, Mr. Verity&mdash;alderman
      and so on. Of course you have the interest of the town at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>with faint irony</i>). As much as you have yourselves, I dare
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>recovering first from the slight general embarrassment</i>). Er,
      yes. Now, don't you think a petition from the Town Council to Sir Charles
      might do the trick? You see, the Polygon's the backbone of the place. I
      can't for the life of me imagine what Sir Charles is thinking of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. The price.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. Now, that's ungenerous of you, Mr. Verity. Sir Charles would never
      be so selfish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>stolidly</i>). Think not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. V</b>. He wouldn't turn us out for money. (<i>Vining and Montgomery are
      not so sure.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. It's hard times for the rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. (<i>timidly</i>). Yes, I suppose it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>with aggression</i>). It is. I know. I'm rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>pompously</i>). I agree with you. We people of independent means
      have been hard hit lately. What with the differential income tax and the
      super tax, we&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. We all think we'd like to pay the super tax, don't we?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Er&mdash;yes&mdash;we can rely on your sending that petition then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Can you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. I thought you said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I don't remember.
    </p>
    <p>

      matter of this sort I'm sure you'll come in with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes? Well, I'm sorry to disoblige you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. M</b>. But surely as an architect&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>interrupting</i>). Now it's no use of you talking. I've said my
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. But you must have some reason. This is really most extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Is it? What's extraordinary in a man getting back a bit of his own?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Have we offended you, Mr. Verity? I'm very sorry. You speak as if you
      had some grudge against us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Grudge? I hate the sight of you if that's your meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>, (<i>rising</i>). This is simply staggering. Why, Mr. Verity, we've
      always been good neighbours, I hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>still sitting</i>). You've kept yourselves to yourselves, if
      that's what you call being good neighbours. Who've you been good
      neighbours to? The shopkeepers? You don't deal with them if you can help
      it. London's your mark when you've money to spend, and that's not every
      day of the week. How often have you got your hand down for a local
      charity? Folks get sick and tired of coming to ask. You buttoned up your
      pockets so tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Other people, at least, don't share your views, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Ask 'em. (<i>Rising.</i>) You silly little set of genteel paupers,
      who did you think you were? (<i>Ladies rise.</i>) We weren't good enough
      for you. You lived in the Polygon; we lived in the town, and you held your
      noses too high to see us if you met us, which wasn't often, because you
      stuck inside your private preserve and didn't have truck with us vulgar
      folk outside. We weren't your class. You patronising snobs, do you fancy I
      can't see through your getting me here and soaping me to send your
      petition from the town for you? The town can go to blazes for all you
      care, so long as you're left alone in your nice big gardens.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. M</b>. Well, I'm sure there's something in what Mr. Verity and Walter
      say. (<i>Sits in armchair above fire.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. No compromise, Mrs. Montgomery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mrs. M</b>. I shall never feel at ease again when I think of the overcrowding
      in the town.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. And my eyes closed, and my nose closed, and gone about Carrington
      without looking at it. No, father, I meant to stir your conscience, and
      I'm glad I've done it. (<i>Sits.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Well, I must admit&mdash;hang it, Verity, if people are crowded why
      don't you build 'em houses? It's your trade.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. There's land enough outside. Why can't the town expand outwards? To
      hear you talk about the Polygon the town might have a wall round it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. Yes, there's lots of moorland about the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Quite so. Lots of moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. Well, then!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Shooting moor. Sir Charles' shooting moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Well, what difference do a few acres more or less make to a shooting
      moor? Surely he'd rather sell you some of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. I'm certain of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>sitting on settee</i>). You're wrong, then. He's holding on for a
      rise. He's held on to this till the value went up. Land here in the
      centre's' worth more, than land outside. This is ripe. The other isn't.
      That's why he'll sell this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>r. c.</i>). Well, if that's really so&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>grimly</i>). It's really so.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Did you think your tin pot rents paid Sir Charles to let land like
      this lie idle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. He likes to have us here. We're desirable tenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Pardon me. As a property owner I know. Desirable tenants are paying
      tenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Do you insinuate that we don't pay?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You don't pay a profitable price. He can make a little gold, mine of
      the Polygon. Land values in the town have been going up all the time. He's
      cute enough to know it, or his agent is. The only question is, will our
      price tempt him or is he able to be greedy and wait a bit longer till the
      land's worth more.
    </p>
    <p>

      all these years?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You've been living in Sir Charles' almshouses for decayed gentlefolk.
      That's our name for it in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Sir!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>calmly</i>). It's the truth. What did it matter to him how little
      he got out of you meantime? He knew very well it's a fortune waiting for
      him whenever he wants it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Mont</b>. I'd no idea of this. (<i>Sits below fire.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You know now. If you hadn't been so busy with thinking what nice
      people you were and what nasty brutes lived outside you'd have found it
      out for yourselves. Not one of you's on lease. You can all be turned out
      at six months' notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. We trusted to Sir Charles' sense of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I wouldn't trust him with sixpence, and I'm a sound Tory at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. I still think you're wrong, sir. You've given us your view. We're
      much obliged. (<i>Sits l.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>

      petition.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Was it? (<i>Turning to Walter.</i>) I thought he'd told you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Unexpectedly strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You've not heard the half of it. You've been the bane of the town.
      It's a working town and it does the working man no good to have the sight
      of a lot of idle people living well and doing nothing for it. Breeds
      discontent. Makes him ask questions. That's what you've been to us. A
      public nuisance. Easy game for every agitator to have his shy at. Do you
      think we employers loved you? They didn't mind us. They could see we
      worked for our living. But you set of do-nothing wastrels&mdash;&mdash;

      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I did my best to gild the pill.
    </p>
    <p>

      little 'uns and talking sweetly about Hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>dropping r. of Walter to below him</i>). Well, now look here, Mr.
      Verity, you needn't suppose that I'm influenced in the slightest by your
      extremely forcible language, but a possible compromise occurs to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Does it? I thought I heard you say just now "no compromise."
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>r. c.</i>). This is a compromise of my own suggesting, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I'm not the compromising sort. Still, go ahead. What's your idea?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. It's this, sir. I grant you we're drones, and I can see there's
      something in what you say about the sight of a few idle people taking a
      lot of room, though I take exception to the way you put it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>drily</i>). Aye.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. (<i>r. c.</i>). Now we've an affection for these houses of ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Of Sir Charles'.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Yes, of Sir Charles'. We're attached to the bricks and mortar. You
      can understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I never thought you'd shift willing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. Just so. We're not willing to shift. But my idea is this. We're all
      old people, and our families have married off. There's no young blood in
      the Polygon, except Walter here and my daughter, to use those tennis
      courts and croquet lawns of ours. They're pleasant to walk about in and
      it's a real sacrifice to part with them. But I propose writing to Sir
      Charles suggesting that if (<i>crossing to l. c. and back; returns to l.
      for end of speech</i>) he cares to sell you some building land outside the
      town we will sacrifice our lawns for a park if he will leave our bricks
      and mortar standing till&mdash;till we old fogies have done with them. How
      does that strike you, Mr. Verity?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. It strikes me your motto will do for me as Well as for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Vin</b>. My motto?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. No compromise, Mr. Vining.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Mr. Verity, surely it's a fair offer. It's generous. It's&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Indeed! If that's your notion of generosity&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Then he gets their letter. Sees they're ready to lose their tennis
      courts. All right, says he, if they're a slack back set of weaklings to
      propose that of themselves, I shan't have any trouble in getting shut of
      them altogether. Their rents aren't worth having. But the company's
      offer's a sound ready cash affair. He's a bit short of the ready, isn't
      he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Aye. Above a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. So when he sees they'll shift without trouble, being weak enough to
      offer a compromise before they're even asked for one, he'll take a flying
      jump at our offer, and there you are. And a good afternoon's work I call
      it.

      seen some warm members in my time.

      <b>Ste</b>. Well, they sent for me. I didn't think this out. I just saw the
      chance while I was there.

    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b>. You don't let much pass you, Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I take my brains along when I go calling of an afternoon on my swell
      friends. I'd like to bet that letter Alcorn's fetching says "Yes" to our

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    <p>
      (<i>Lucy sits in armchair l. above fire.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Since then, you see, I've made discoveries. If a man is known by
      the company he keeps, the same applies to a woman. The woman I'm going to
      marry doesn't, help to form a robbery syndicate along with Messieurs
      Alcorn, Smithson and Bamford. So if you thought to buy my silence by
      giving me your daughter, you made a bad mistake. No. Bamford's the man for
      her. Partners in scoundrelism, partners in life.

      (<i>Enter Bamford l. and crosses r. c.</i>)

    <p>

    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>, On being my successful rival for the hand of Miss Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. What's this? Was <i>he</i> the other you spoke of? (<i>To Stephen.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>to Lucy</i>). Don't be afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. (<i>to Walter</i>). Who told you about me?
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. (<i>r. c.</i>). Does it? Well, there's two sorts of news. Correct
      news and incorrect news. Both sorts gets round, but incorrect news gets
      round most. See what I mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>sternly</i>). I don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. (<i>to Stephen</i>). You will. (<i>To Walter.</i>) Look here, have
      you given her up?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. You wouldn't have me stand in your way, would you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. So you <i>have</i> given her up. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Oh, I had my reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Had you now? I'd like to hear those reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. That's not quite fair to the lady, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. No. He's out of it.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. It's all square, man. She's yours now.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. (<i>r. c., awkwardly</i>). Well, I've been thinking things over. The

    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>grimly</i>). Yes, go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. (<i>desperately</i>). It means giving up too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>c.</i>). And a good thing, too, Sam Bamford. How much longer do
      you think you'll last at the pace you go? You're cracking up already&mdash;not
      half the man you were.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b> (<i>icily</i>). Think how nice it would be to have me for a nurse. I
      warm father's carpet slippers beautifully, don't I, and my gruel's a
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. There's many a long day between me and carpet slippers and gruel. I
      like roving about, Verity, and that's a fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Didn't you think of that before?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. I spoke hurried.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. It's time you settled down. You won't lose much that a thousand a
      year and home comforts don't match.

    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. I'm rich enough.

    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. (<i>irritably</i>). I tell you, I've thought things over. Fact is, I
      didn't half like the way she answered you back. A man gets enough worries
      in his working day. When he gets home he wants peace and no back answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. She's all right now. It was having him asking (<i>indicating Walter</i>)
      that made her proud. He's thrown her over&mdash;not good enough for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. And she's not good enough for me, either. I can be a bit particular
      myself. I like 'em quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. She's as quiet as they make 'em.

    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Father, I absolutely and finally decline to marry Mr. Bamford.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. I ask you, does that sound like a quiet life?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well, damme, Sam Bamford, you can't get a thousand a year without
      paying a tax on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. You can pay too much tax if you get a woman thrown in with a razor
      instead of a tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>disgustedly</i>). I thought you were a man of your word.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. And I thought you cracked to be a friend of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I am your friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Perhaps; but as a rule when a man's as anxious as you are to sell an
      article I begin to think there's something wrong with the goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Didn't I tell you on Tuesday I didn't want her to marry at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Didn't Sir Charles' agent write me he wouldn't want to sell? And you
      know what you said about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. But I'm not selling. I'm giving.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Yes, and nobody ever knew you to give away anything worth having.
      What's he given her the chuck for, if it comes to that? He knows
      something.

      I never asked either of you to come after my daughter. You came because
      you liked, but you'll not cry off when you like.

      now. I know what she is.
    </p>
    <p>

      then, which of you is it to be?

      II. Lucy stands r., Walter sits below fire.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Alcorn</b>. Well, gentlemen, he won't sell. (<i>Taking out letter.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Refuses to sell? What does this mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b>, (<i>to Bamford</i>). And you assured us he was broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. So he was, absolutely broke. I don't understand it at all. .
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Al</b>. No more do I. Listen to this. (<i>Reading letter.</i>) "I regret my
      inability to entertain the offer made by your company. I have reason to
      believe that owing to overcrowding the land is urgently wanted and that
      the town authorities wish to deal with the matter themselves. I am having
      the tennis lawns, etc., valued independently and the town may then
      purchase at the valuation. I shall, however, not disturb my old tenants in
      the Polygon, this letter referring only to the open space now used as
      tennis lawns." Now what in thunder do you make of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>looking at Walter</i>). You?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. A letter to Monte Carlo only costs tuppence-halfpenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. But hang it, Verity, the town isn't buying.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. On the contrary, Sam, the town is. The overcrowding is a scandal. We
      must have some fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b>. Oh, don't talk like a blooming philanthropist again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I'm talking like a blooming alderman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Al</b>. This isn't a town's meeting. It's a company meeting. Stick to company
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. The company has no further business. The company is wound up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Damned if it is. This letter doesn't end all. It's your fault,
      Verity. You shouldn't have gone to the Polygon. You over-reached yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. This would still have happened, Sam, in any case.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. I don't see it. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Mr. Montgomery can tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Well, it's not all up. Let's have what he offers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. He doesn't offer us anything. He offers it to the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Al</b>. And the town must buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. The town shall buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Yes; well I said houses. Let's make it houses. Model dwellings as
      ugly as hell, for the Polygon toffs to look at every time they poke their
      noses out of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Don't be spiteful, Sam. We've had a licking, but don't bear malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Thank you, Mr. Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Oh, I'd forgotten you were there. Oblige me by going into that room
      for two minutes. You can wait in there till we're through.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. But what have I to wait for? (<i>Rises.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Sorry to occupy your valuable, time, but you're going to wait. You'll
      find a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Exit Walter l.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      That chap's wasted as a curate. (<i>Sits.</i>) He's beaten me! Me licked
      by a bricking curate!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Al</b>. But I don't understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Oh, he got hold of our company idea, told Sir Charles and smashed our
      plans. That's all. Nothing very serious. We're out of pocket for a few
      expenses that won't hurt any of us, and we've missed a good piece of
      plunder. Well, the thing to do now is to turn round and do the handsome
      over that recreation ground. <i>Our</i> idea for the benefit of the town!
      <i>My</i> negotiations with the Polygon! If we can't get cash by it,
      gentlemen, let us get credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b>.. And what about the rates?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well, what about them? More fresh air, less ill health. Less ill
      health, less poverty. Less poverty, fewer paupers. That recreation ground
      'ull pay for itself in less than no time. If there's going to be any
      barging about the rates we'll raise the money by subscription, and for two
      pins I'll head the list myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Al</b>. It's a queer finish to our plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. It is a finish, Alcorn. We're knocked out, and we've got to take it
      with a big, broad smile and nobody will even so much as guess we've meant
      anything but the square thing all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. That curate 'ull talk. Curates are always talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. No, he won't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. You can't stop an old woman gossiping. Gab's a parson's
      stock-in-trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. He's no old woman. He's a wide-awake young man and he's going to
      marry my daughter&mdash;if she's free. That'll shut his mouth for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b>. Well, we'll leave that to you, Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. You can, safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Al</b>. It's been a lot of trouble all for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Rises; general rise.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well, we're good sportsmen, I hope, and the Carrington recreation
      ground 'ull be an everlasting monument to our civic enterprise and public
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Al</b>. Aye, I'm beginning to feel good already.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b>. It's a disappointment, Verity. Ah, well, we can't win every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. No. Better luck next time. Good night, Smithson. (<i>Takes chair up
      stage.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b>. Good night. Good night all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Al</b>. I'm coming your way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Smiths</b>. Come along then. (<i>Crosses r.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Al</b>. Good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Exeunt Smithson and Alcorn, r.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. I'm glad they've gone. Something to put to you, Verity, private.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. About her?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Her? No. I've said my say about that, and you need her to shut the
      curate's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I'll shut his mouth without that if you want her. It's a thousand a
      year, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. The auction recommences, Mr. Bamford.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Don't fret yourself, Miss Verity. I'm not bidding. You've had my last
      word, Verity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well, what's this you want to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. About me being mayor. That stands, of course?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. No, it doesn't. (<i>Above table.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. But&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. That was a contract made by a company that's wound up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. But, hang it, I'd counted on being mayor. I've mentioned it to one or
      two. (<i>Goes above table R.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. All right, then. There's your mayoress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Is that the price?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. There's your mayoress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. I won't be haggled over.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Miss Verity, it's not you. If I wanted to marry I dunno as I'd look
      an inch further. It's&mdash;I'm not the marrying sort and that's top and
      bottom of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Sam, I'll be mayor myself if it's only for the fun of opening that
      recreation ground to the public and making a speech about the anxious
      negotiating the Council had to do before they brought off this great
      scheme and conferred an inestimable boon on the deserving working classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Oh, if you're putting up for mayor, I retire. I can't fight a man of
      your weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Fight be hanged. We're good friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Aye. You've got your man in there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Well! (<i>Pause.</i>) Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. It's very sweet of you not to want to marry me, Mr. Bamford.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. Ask me to the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes, you should be good for a thumping present after this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. I'll stand my corner. You've to tackle the curate. I'll be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. Good night, and thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bam</b>. It's <i>me</i> that's thankful. Good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Exit Bamford. Stephen crosses to left door, opens it and calls.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Now, Mr. Montgomery.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter Walter. Lucy rises, l.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Well, sir? (<i>Crosses to r. below table.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>c. above table</i>). Are you or are you not going to marry my
      daughter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. That depends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I'll tell you something. The syndicate's bust. In fact, there never
      was a syndicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. You mustn't ask me to believe that, sir. You gave the thing away
      yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. (<i>impressively</i>). There never was a syndicate. A limited company
      isn't a limited company till it's registered. We weren't registered. You
      understand? You can't go telling people about a syndicate that never
      existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b> (<i>smiling</i>). That sounds reasonable. I shan't tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. Yes. Well, what about my daughter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. I thought you objected to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I did. But I begin to think there's more in you than meets the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Thanks for the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. I do wish you weren't a curate, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Crosses to fire.</i>) There's nothing in the Church for a smart man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. There are plenty of prizes in the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Lucy</b>. And Walter's going to win them, father. (<i>Up to Walter.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. He's not won much yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Walter</b>. This is all the prize I want, Mr. Verity. (<i>Takes her hand.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Ste</b>. She's not a bad start, either. You've got round me, and it takes a
      bit of doing. (<i>Crosses to Walter.</i>) Look here, my lad, I come of a
      long lived stock and you'll disappoint me if I don't see you a bishop
      before I die. I'll come to the Palace, Lucy, and hang my hat up some day.
      (<i>Going to exit to leave them together.</i>)

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
